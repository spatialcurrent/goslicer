# goslicer

## Description

**goslicer** is a simple command line program for slicing lines.  **goslicer** supports the following operating systems and architectures.

## Platforms

The following platforms are supported.  Pull requests to support other platforms are welcome!

| GOOS | GOARCH |
| ---- | ------ |
| darwin | amd64 |
| linux | amd64 |
| windows | amd64 |
| linux | arm64 |

## Releases

Find releases at [https://github.com/spatialcurrent/goslicer/releases](https://github.com/spatialcurrent/goslicer/releases).  You might want to rename your binary to just `goslicer`.  See the **Building** section below to build from scratch.

**Darwin**

- `goslicer_darwin_amd64` - CLI for Darwin on amd64 (includes `macOS` and `iOS` platforms)

**Linux**

- `goslicer_linux_amd64` - CLI for Linux on amd64
- `goslicer_linux_amd64` - CLI for Linux on arm64

**Windows**

- `goslicer_windows_amd64.exe` - CLI for Windows on amd64

## Usage

See the usage below or the following examples.

```shell
goslicer is a simple tool for slicing lines.
START must be greater than or equal to zero.
END supports negative indicies (as subtracted from the total length).

Usage:
  goslicer START [END]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for goslicer
```

# Examples

**First 10 bytes for each line**

```shell
cat FILE | goslicer 0 10
```

**Last 10 bytes for each line**

```shell
cat FILE | goslicer -10
```

**Bytes in middle of line**

```shell
cat FILE | goslicer 10 20
```

## Building

Use `make help` to see help information for each target.

**CLI**

The `make build_cli` script is used to build executables for Linux and Windows.  Use `make install` for standard installation as a go executable.

**Changing Destination**

The default destination for build artifacts is `bin`, but you can change the destination with an environment variable.  For building on a Chromebook consider saving the artifacts in `/usr/local/go/bin`, e.g., `DEST=/usr/local/go/bin make build_cli`

## Testing

**CLI**

To run CLI testes use `make test_cli`, which uses [shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2).  If you recive a `shunit2:FATAL Please declare TMPDIR with path on partition with exec permission.` error, you can modify the `TMPDIR` environment variable in line or with `export TMPDIR=<YOUR TEMP DIRECTORY HERE>`. For example:

```
TMPDIR="/usr/local/tmp" make test_cli
```

**Go**

To run Go tests use `make test_go` (or `bash scripts/test.sh`), which runs unit tests, `go vet`, `go vet with shadow`, [errcheck](https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck), [ineffassign](https://github.com/gordonklaus/ineffassign), [staticcheck](https://staticcheck.io/), and [misspell](https://github.com/client9/misspell).
